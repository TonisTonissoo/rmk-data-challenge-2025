# RMK Data Challenge 2025

## Objective

This project aims to estimate the probability that **Rita**, who commutes by **bus number 8** in Tallinn, arrives late to her daily 9:05 AM meeting depending on her departure time from home.

The goal is to simulate various scenarios and visualize the relationship between departure time and likelihood of being late.

## Structure

- `src/`: Python scripts organized by function:
  - `simulate.py`: Simulates bus journeys and calculates lateness
  - `process_data.py`: Handles loading and cleaning of data
  - `plot_results.py`: Visualizations
- `data/`: Raw and processed data
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration
- `tests/`: Unit tests
- `main.py`: Pipeline entrypoint
- `requirements.txt`: Python package requirements

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
